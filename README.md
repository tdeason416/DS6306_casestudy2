Introduction
------------

We are performing exploratory data analysis for a Fortune 1000 company.
We are examining employee attrition with the goal of identifying key
factors that contribute to attrition. Factors that prevent attrition
will also be examined. The data used was provided by the company and
includes information on 1470 full-time employees. Including attrition, a
total of 35 variables were measured for each employee. All data entries
were complete. (No N/A's in the dataset.) This included numeric data
such as age and income as well as categorical data such as their roles
and department they work in.


Project Goals
-------------

-   Identify (at least) the top three factors that contribute
    to turnover.

-   Learn about any job role specific trends that may exist in the data
    set

-   Provide any other interesting trends and observations from your
    analysis
  
-   Attempt to Build a Linear model to predict factors important to management.
